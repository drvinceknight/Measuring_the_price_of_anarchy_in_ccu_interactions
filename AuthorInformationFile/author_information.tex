\textbf{Statement of contribution:}

This paper contributes to the operational research literature in two main ways:

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Application of Game Theory to a healthcare system with a view to
        understanding choice of performance targets.
    \item Theoretical results as to the existence of Nash equilibria in pure
        strategies for the specific game considered.
\end{itemize}

The contribution is novel by placing an analytical stochastic model of critical
care unit interaction in a game theoretic context. The utilities of the game are
outputs of the stochastic model. Further to this the game is solved using a
simple search thanks to a theoretic result proving the existence of a pure Nash
equilibrium.

Various numerical results are offered which help describe the best design of
incentives so that each critical care unit acts in a coordinated way.
