# Measuring the Price of Anarchy in CCU Interactions

Source code and [Sage](http://sagemath.org/) scripts for a paper aiming to model from a game theoretic point of the view the effect of selfish behaviour in a Critical Care Unit network.

Sage is used to solve a 2 dimensional Markov chain (by obtaining the basis of the Kernel of the corresponding transition rate matrix).

Data for the paper can be found [here](drvinceknight/measuring..://sage.maths.cf.ac.uk/home/pub/122/).
